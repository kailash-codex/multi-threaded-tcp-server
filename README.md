# Multi Threaded TCP Server

This algorithm demonstrates how a Multi Threaded TCP Server works.

TCP Server that listens to a port 2212. Requests made to port 2212, as simple as "curl https://localhost:2212" will be listened then accpeted by the TCP Server. Then, the request is read, in our example, nothing is passed to the TCP Server, and the TCP Server returns a response "Hello World!".
